# Machine Learning Bootcamp

# Day 1

### Machine learning LifeCycle
Prep Data
Build Model
Deploy Model

### Libraries to import:
Supervised
Unsupervised
Reinforcement 

Also learned about the loss function 
and how to reduce loss: Gradient Descent

Also learned linear regression. And trained linear regression y=mx +c is a linear regression for a single variable input and output
With the example in Day1

### Libraries to import:
tensor flow
pytorch
pandas
matplotlib

We used scatter to plot the details

Result : how to develop model and train model

# Day 2

### Logistic Regression

Straight line in linear regression
S Curve in logistic Regression = Sigmoid Curve

Sigmoid: sigma(z) = 1/1+e^-z This equation gives either 0 or 1 or the value between them.

Binary Cross Entropy Loss

Linear Regression is used to handle regression problems whereas Logistic regression is used to handle the classification problems.
if the predicted values should be probabilities rather than outcomes and the dependent variable is binary logistic regression is preferred over linear regression
