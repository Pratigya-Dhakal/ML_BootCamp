# Machine Learning Bootcamp

## Day 1

### Machine learning LifeCycle
Prep Data
Build Model
Deploy Model

### Libraries to import:
Supervised
Unsupervised
Reinforcement 

Also learned linear regression. And trained linear regression y=mx +c
With the example in Day1

### Libraries to import:
tensor flow
pytorch
pandas
matplotlib

We used scatter to plot the details

Result : how to develop model and train model
